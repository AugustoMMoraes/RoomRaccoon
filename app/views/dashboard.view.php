        <h3>Hi RoomRaccon Staff!</h3><br>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my assessment!</p>
        <p>I've built this entire dashboard from scratch, it might look a bit 'empty' but i've tried to make it comfy without any framework.</p>
        <p>I could have used bootstrap to make this look more modern, but it would beat the purpose of this test.</p><br>
